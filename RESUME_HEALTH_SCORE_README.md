# Resume Health Score Feature

## Overview

The Resume Health Score is a comprehensive system that analyzes resume quality across multiple dimensions and provides a holistic grade (A-F) with actionable improvement suggestions. This feature helps users understand their resume's strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to make targeted improvements.

## Features

### 🎯 **Impact Analysis** (Implemented)
- **Strong Action Verbs**: Identifies impactful verbs like "achieved," "increased," "led," "implemented"
- **Quantifiable Results**: Detects numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, timeframes, and counts
- **Outcome Indicators**: Recognizes clear result statements like "resulted in," "led to," "enabled"
- **Weak Verb Detection**: Flags weak verbs like "helped," "assisted," "was responsible for"

### 🎨 **Design Analysis** (Planned)
- **White Space Analysis**: Evaluates readability through spacing and density
- **Section Length**: Analyzes appropriate section proportions
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Assesses formatting and organization

### 🛠️ **Skills Analysis** (Planned)
- **Market Relevance**: Cross-references skills with current job market trends
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing skills for target roles
- **Technology Currency**: Evaluates how up-to-date skills are

### 📝 **Clarity Analysis** (Planned)
- **Section Organization**: Evaluates logical flow and structure
- **Role Clarity**: Assesses how clearly job responsibilities are defined
- **Achievement Focus**: Measures how well accomplishments are highlighted

## Architecture

### Core Classes

#### `ResumeHealthAnalyzer`
Main orchestrator class that coordinates analysis across all dimensions.

#### `ImpactAnalyzer`
Specialized analyzer for evaluating the impact of experience bullet points.

#### `DimensionScore`
Data structure containing score, grade, feedback, and suggestions for each dimension.

#### `ResumeHealthScore`
Complete analysis result with overall score, grade, and detailed breakdown.

### Scoring System

#### Grade Scale
- **A+ (95-100)**: Exceptional resume with outstanding impact
- **A (90-94)**: Excellent resume with strong impact
- **A- (85-89)**: Very good resume with solid impact
- **B+ (80-84)**: Good resume with good impact
- **B (75-79)**: Above average resume
- **B- (70-74)**: Average resume with room for improvement
- **C+ (65-69)**: Below average resume
- **C (60-64)**: Resume needs significant improvement
- **C- (55-59)**: Poor resume quality
- **D+ (50-54)**: Very poor resume
- **D (45-49)**: Extremely poor resume
- **D- (40-44)**: Almost failing resume
- **F (0-39)**: Failing resume

#### Impact Scoring Breakdown
- **Strong Action Verbs**: +20 points each
- **Quantifiable Results**: +25 points each
- **Clear Outcomes**: +15 points each
- **Weak Action Verbs**: -10 points each

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from services.resume_health_analyzer import analyze_resume_health

# Sample resume data
resume_data = {
    'experience': '''
    • Increased sales by 25% through targeted marketing campaigns
    • Led team of 5 developers to deliver project 2 weeks early
    • Achieved 40% reduction in processing time through automation
    '''
}

# Analyze resume health
result = analyze_resume_health(resume_data)

# Access results
print(f"Overall Grade: {result.overall_grade.value}")
print(f"Overall Score: {result.overall_score:.1f}/100")
print(f"Summary: {result.summary}")

# Access impact analysis
impact = result.dimension_scores['impact']
print(f"Impact Grade: {impact.grade.value}")
print(f"Impact Score: {impact.score:.1f}/100")

# Get feedback and suggestions
for feedback in impact.feedback:
    print(f"• {feedback}")

for suggestion in impact.suggestions:
    print(f"• {suggestion}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from services.resume_health_analyzer import ResumeHealthAnalyzer

# Create analyzer instance
analyzer = ResumeHealthAnalyzer()

# Analyze specific sections
experience_section = "Your experience text here..."
impact_score = analyzer.impact_analyzer.analyze_impact(experience_section)

# Get detailed analysis
print(f"Score: {impact_score.score:.1f}/100")
print(f"Grade: {impact_score.grade.value}")
```

## Testing

Run the test script to see the analyzer in action:

```bash
python test_impact_analyzer.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Weak resume analysis (poor impact)
- Mixed resume analysis (some good points)
- Strong resume analysis (excellent impact)
- Empty resume handling

## Example Output

### Strong Resume Example
```
Overall Grade: A
Overall Score: 85.0/100

Summary: Excellent resume with strong impact (A). Your bullet points effectively showcase achievements with quantifiable results.

Impact Analysis:
Grade: A
Score: 85.0/100

Feedback:
• Total bullet points analyzed: 6
• High-impact bullets: 6
• Medium-impact bullets: 0
• Low-impact bullets: 0

Suggestions:
• Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
• Include specific metrics and outcomes for each achievement
```

### Weak Resume Example
```
Overall Grade: D
Overall Score: 15.0/100

Summary: Resume requires significant improvement (D). Prioritize restructuring experience section with impactful achievements.

Impact Analysis:
Grade: D
Score: 15.0/100

Feedback:
• Total bullet points analyzed: 6
• High-impact bullets: 0
• Medium-impact bullets: 0
• Low-impact bullets: 6

Suggestions:
• Replace weak action verbs with strong, impactful verbs
• Add quantifiable results to most bullet points (numbers, percentages, timeframes)
• Add more detailed bullet points to showcase achievements
• Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
```

## Implementation Details

### Impact Analyzer Features

#### Strong Action Verbs
The analyzer recognizes 40+ strong action verbs including:
- Achievement: achieved, accomplished, delivered, completed
- Leadership: led, managed, coordinated, facilitated
- Innovation: developed, created, built, implemented
- Improvement: increased, improved, enhanced, optimized
- Efficiency: streamlined, automated, reduced, eliminated

#### Quantifiable Patterns
Detects various types of measurable results:
- Percentages: 25%, 40%, 100%
- Dollar amounts: $500K, $2M, $50K
- Counts: 5 developers, 1M+ records, 3 people
- Time periods: 2 weeks early, daily, monthly

- Passive: was responsible for, handled, processed
- Vague: helped, assisted, supported, participated
- Generic: maintained, monitored, reviewed, documented

### Extensibility

The system is designed to be easily extended with new analyzers:

```python
class DesignAnalyzer:
    def analyze_design(self, resume_data: Dict) -> DimensionScore:
        # Implement design analysis logic
        pass

class SkillsAnalyzer:
    def analyze_skills(self, resume_data: Dict) -> DimensionScore:
        # Implement skills analysis logic
        pass

class ClarityAnalyzer:
    def analyze_clarity(self, resume_data: Dict) -> DimensionScore:
        # Implement clarity analysis logic
        pass
```
