# ResuMatch Skill Transformer

## Overview

The Skill Transformer is a core component of ResuMatch that intelligently transforms your real skills and experience to match different job roles. It allows you to present the same capabilities through different professional lenses without lying or fabricating experience.

## How It Works

### 1. **Skills Mapping Database**
- Located in `data/skills_mapping.json`
- Maps each skill to role-specific professional phrases
- Covers 23+ core tech skills and 97+ different roles

### 2. **Intelligent Transformation**
- Takes your real skill (e.g., "Python")
- Transforms it based on target role (e.g., "Data Scientist")
- Returns role-appropriate professional language

### 3. **Role Category Matching**
- Automatically detects role categories (Engineering, Data, Business, etc.)
- Provides fallback transformations for related roles
- Ensures maximum compatibility across different job types

## File Structure

```
resumatch/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ skills_mapping.json          # Skills mapping database
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ skill_transformer.py         # Core transformation logic
â””â”€â”€ test_skill_transformer.py        # Test and demo script
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from services.skill_transformer import transform_skill

# Transform a skill for a specific role
result = transform_skill("Python", "Data Scientist")
# Returns: "Developed data pipelines and statistical models using Python"

result = transform_skill("Python", "DevOps Engineer")
# Returns: "Automated infrastructure provisioning using Python scripts"
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
from services.skill_transformer import SkillTransformer

# Initialize transformer
transformer = SkillTransformer()

# Transform skills
python_for_data = transformer.transform_skill("Python", "Data Scientist")
python_for_devops = transformer.transform_skill("Python", "DevOps Engineer")
python_for_pm = transformer.transform_skill("Python", "Product Manager")

# Get available roles for a skill
python_roles = transformer.get_skill_roles("Python")
# Returns: ['Data Scientist', 'DevOps Engineer', 'Software Engineer', ...]

# Get all available skills and roles
all_skills = transformer.get_available_skills()
all_roles = transformer.get_available_roles()
```

## Adding New Skills

To add new skills to the mapping:

1. **Edit `data/skills_mapping.json`**
2. **Add new skill entry**:
```json
"NewSkill": {
  "Role Type 1": "Professional phrase for Role Type 1",
  "Role Type 2": "Professional phrase for Role Type 2"
}
```

3. **Reload the transformer**:
```python
transformer.reload_mapping()
```

## Adding New Roles

To add new roles:

1. **Add role to existing skills** in the mapping file
2. **Update role categories** in `_get_role_categories()` method
3. **Test with new role** to ensure proper matching

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_skill_transformer.py
```

This will test:
- Basic transformations
- Role category matching
- Non-existent skill handling
- Available skills and roles
- Convenience function

## Integration with Resume Generator

The Skill Transformer integrates with the main resume generator to:

1. **Analyze job descriptions** for required skills
2. **Transform user skills** to match job requirements
3. **Generate role-specific** resume content
4. **Optimize for ATS** systems
