# ResuMatch - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We Built

**ResuMatch** is a smart resume generator that automatically matches your experience to job descriptions, creating ATS-friendly resumes that actually get you interviews.

- Extracts key requirements from job descriptions using NLP
- Matches your experience with job requirements
- Generates optimized resumes that pass ATS systems
- Highlights skills you can actually demonstrate
